This repository contains the source code of the evaluation tool used in the paper "Nanoparticle Classification Using Frequency Domain Analysis on Resource-Limited Platforms".
The work is about frequency domain based virus classification with PAMONO sensor images.
The results are published here: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/19/4138.

How to use this tool:

1. Go to http://www.fftw.org/, and download and compile the latest fftw library (libfftw3f.a) for your platform (executing sudo ./configure --enable-float && sudo make install) in the fftw folder.
2. Insert the library file into the lib folder of this repository.
3. Open run_eval.cpp, and if desired, edit the evaluation parameters (the first six macros). 
4. Run "make" in the root of this repository to compile the tool.
5. Execute ./run_eval to execute the experiments and view the results.
